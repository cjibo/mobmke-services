This project was demoed during my Talking to Websites presentation for
MobileMKE.  I covered talking to json services from both iOS and
Android.  There are three projects in the src directory.  The projects
include an xCode 4.4 project for iPhone, an Android application and a
Ruby on Rails application.  The application is already currently running
at http://cryptic-hamlet-3757.herokuapp.com/.  

The Rails application has a meetings controller and also has an admin
account which is cgibeaut@insomdev.com with password of TestMobileMKE.
I will keep the heroku instance running for a month or so.  After that
it anyone else can deploy the code if they would like.

This code is free to grab and demo.  No restrictions.
